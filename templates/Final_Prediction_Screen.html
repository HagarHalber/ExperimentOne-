                     Fibonacci ratios indicate that the stock has been trading in the 70%-100% range in recent weeks, indicating a
                     strong position. Based on a triple-top pattern that emerged between May and September another such pattern was
                     identified near the $208 price point, indicating that the stock may experience a decline to $195 per share before

                     strong financial results, including an increase in revenue. The company has expanded into a number of new markets in recent years,
                     including the Data Center GPUs market, which includes deep learning and machine learning platforms. These efforts have contributed
                     to the company's overall success and growth. In addition to its core businesses, Nvidia has also ventured into the automotive and
                     visualization industries. These expansions have led to a significant increase in the company's operating income.
                     The company's financial performance is reflected in its strong free cash flow and positive earnings per share.
                     According to market analysis, the company's stock has shown an upward trend in recent months and has been trading at strong levels.
                     However, there is a key resistance point that the stock has struggled to overcome in the past the algorithm analyzed the stock's behavior

                     and other related technologies with a market capitalization of $518B.Its most recent financial reports show revenue
                     of $16.7B, a total revenue increase of 68% from the previous year, and a gross margin of 65.6%. The company has recently
                     entered the Data Center GPUs market, which includes deep learning and machine learning platforms. Its revenue from this
                     market has increased by $4.7B, or 41%, from the previous year. The algorithm has identified an overall upward trend in the
                     stock starting in Jun, with the stock trading in the strong 70%-100% range according to Fibonacci ratios in recent weeks.
                     There is a strong resistance point at 208$, which the stock reached for the first time in October. After this, there was a
                     drop, followed by the stock reaching the 208$ point again, the same pattern emerged between May and September and was identified
                     as triple-top therefore the algorithm predict a triple-top pattern at 208$. As the stock has reached the second top of this pattern,
                     it is expected to drop before returning to the resistance point at 208$. Based on this information and the graph, the algorithm predicts a
                     drop in price to 195$ per share.</p>
