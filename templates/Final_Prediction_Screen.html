                     detect patterns, and make a financial analysis of the presented company. The stock's graph indicates an
                     uptrend starting in mid-Jun, and the Fibonacci ratios indicate that the stock has been trading in the 70%-100%
                     range in recent weeks, indicating a strong position. Based on a triple-top pattern that emerged between May
                     and September, another pattern was identified near the $208 price point, indicating that the stock may
                     experience a decline to $198 per share before rebounding to the resistance point.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 20px" class="justify-content-center">Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a
                     company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future
                     price could yield significant profit. The efficient-market hypothesis suggests that stock prices reflect all
                     currently available information and any price changes that are not based on newly revealed information thus
                     are inherently unpredictable. Others believe they have methods and technologies which purportedly allow them
                     to gain future price information. Therefore, the optimal prediction for the stock price is $198 per share.</p>
